About me

I'm a master student in Data Science at the University of Pisa with a strong academic background in banking and finance. I enjoy bridging my two passions about computer science and applied math with some projects that also help me improving my proficiency in Python, Machine Learning and time series analysis.

Beyond my academic journey, I'm an amateur drummer and an animals lover. I'm committed to applying my skills and knowledge to real-world challenges.
